# React-SSR
An example WebApp that implements server-side rendering of React  
I created this repo starting from https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactSSRCasts.

## How to use:

* Download repo
* Run "yarn dev" to build for dev
* Run "yarn release" to build for prod
* ???
* Profit

## Next Steps

* ~~Improved project structure~~
* ~~Unified and improved webpack.config~~
* ~~Typescript~~
* Add aliases... it's embarassing (eventually)
* ~~code chunking~~
* ~~gzip~~
* sass using css modules
* avoid double API call server + client
* purecomponents
* performance webpack plugin
* Jest
* PM2
* Apollo + GraphQL ?
* Babel AFTER Typescript
* install babel-plugin-transform-react-constant-elements and babel-plugin-transform-react-inline-elements 
* strict Typescript
* a violent TSLint
* prefetch other bundles?
* a violent editorconfig
