I created this repo starting from https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReactSSRCasts.

## How to use:

* Download repo
* Run "yarn dev" to build for dev
* Run "yarn release" to build for prod

* Profit

## Next Steps

* ~~Improved project structure~~
* ~~Unified and improved webpack.config~~
* ~~Typescript~~
* Add aliases... it's embarassing
* code chunking
* sass using css modules
* performance webpack plugin
* Jest
* Babel AFTER Typescript
* strict Typescript
* a violent TSLint
* Apollo + GraphQL ?
* a violent editorconfig
